## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of this community pledge to respect all individuals participating in our project and community, regardless of their background, identity, or experience level. We aim to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute.

## Our Standards
We expect all members of our community to adhere to the following standards of behavior:

- **Inclusivity:** We welcome and encourage participation from individuals of all backgrounds and experiences. Discrimination, harassment, and exclusionary practices have no place in our community.

- **Respect:** Treat all community members with respect and kindness. Be considerate of differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences. Disagreements may arise, but constructive discussions and respectful language are essential.

- **Collaboration:** Foster a collaborative and supportive environment. Help and support fellow community members in their development, design, documentation, and community engagement efforts. Together, we can grow and achieve our goals.

- **Professionalism:** Maintain a high level of professionalism and integrity in all interactions within the community. Refrain from engaging in behavior that may be deemed offensive, disrespectful, or harmful.

- **Accountability:** Take responsibility for your actions and their impact on the community. If someone raises an issue or concern, listen with an open mind, reflect on your behavior, and make appropriate changes when necessary.

- **Open-Mindedness:** Embrace new ideas, approaches, and perspectives. Encourage innovation, experimentation, and continuous learning within the community.

- **Action-Oriented:** We support the implementation of personal ideas and encourage diverse approaches to problem-solving. You are free to explore different tools and methods, including AI tools, to enhance your problem-solving and action-taking abilities.

- **Source Attribution:** While we encourage learning from various channels like YouTube, we discourage exact copies. If you draw inspiration from other sources, please provide relevant attributions and acknowledgments in your submissions. We appreciate contributions from other communities and will merge them in accordance with their open-source license requirements.

## Our Responsibilities
As community maintainers, we are responsible for upholding these standards and ensuring a positive community environment. We will take appropriate and fair action in response to any reported incidents of unacceptable behavior. Our aim is to foster a healthy and inclusive community where all members can thrive and contribute.

## Reporting Incidents
If you experience or witness any behavior that violates the Community Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it. Incidents can be reported to the project maintainers by contacting opensource-conduct@jiangxue.org. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. We are committed to addressing and resolving reported issues promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement
In cases where a community member violates the Community Code of Conduct, we will take appropriate action. This may include issuing warnings, temporary or permanent bans from community participation, or other measures deemed necessary to maintain a safe and inclusive environment. Our enforcement actions will be fair, unbiased, and focused on fostering a positive community culture.

## Our Shared Commitment
By participating in this community, you are expected to uphold these standards and contribute to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment.
