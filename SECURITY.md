## Reporting Security Issues

At Qionglou, we take security seriously and value the contribution of external security researchers to help maintain a secure environment for our users. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or potential issues within our component library, we encourage you to responsibly disclose them to us.

To report a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. Submit a detailed report to our security team via email at security@jiangxue.org. Please include a clear description of the vulnerability, along with any steps or proof of concept that can help us understand and reproduce the issue.
2. Our security team will acknowledge your report within within seven working days and begin the investigation process.
3. We kindly request that you allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the reported issue before disclosing it publicly or to any third parties.
4. Once the security issue has been resolved, we will provide proper credit and recognition to the reporting party, if desired.

## Security Audits and Assessments

We are committed to maintaining a high level of security for our users. To ensure the integrity and safety of our codebase, we regularly conduct internal security audits and assessments.

These audits involve:

1. Reviewing our codebase for potential security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and authentication and authorization issues.
2. Implementing security best practices and industry-standard techniques to protect against common security threats.
3. Performing regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
4. Monitoring security-related forums, communities, and bug tracking systems to stay informed about emerging security threats and patches.

## Bug Bounty Program

To further encourage the community's involvement in ensuring the security of our component library, we have established a Bug Bounty Program. This program rewards security researchers who discover and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities according to our responsible disclosure guidelines.

If you are interested in participating in our Bug Bounty Program, please refer to our [Bug Bounty Program Policy](https://github.com/jsrac/qionglou/wiki/Security-Policy/) for detailed information on eligibility, scope, rewards, and submission guidelines.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers in helping us maintain the security of our component library. To ensure a coordinated and responsible approach to vulnerability disclosure, we kindly request that you adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Do not attempt to exploit or compromise other users' accounts, data, or systems during your security research.
2. Do not publicly disclose any identified vulnerabilities until we have had sufficient time to address them.
3. Avoid violating any laws or regulations during your security research activities.
4. Respect the privacy and confidentiality of our users' data.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions, concerns, or need to report a security issue that cannot be shared publicly, please contact our security team at security@jiangxue.org.

We appreciate your commitment to keeping our component library safe and secure. Together, we can create a trusted and reliable environment for all users.

Please note that this Security Policy is subject to change and updates without prior notice.
